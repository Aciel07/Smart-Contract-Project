# Smart-Contract-Project

## Description
This Solidity project is a modified simple token system that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements. The token contract includes basic functionality for minting and burning tokens, while keeping track of token balances and total supply. 

### Key Features:
- **Token Information**: The contract publicly stores details about the token, abbreviation, and the total supply of tokens.
- **Minting Functionality**: New tokens can be created and assigned to a specific address. The total supply of tokens is increased by the number of tokens minted, and the recipient's balance is updated accordingly.
- **Burning Functionality**: Allows token holders to eliminate tokens, reducing the total supply and the balance of the address holding the tokens. It also includes checks to ensure that the address has sufficient tokens before proceeding.

### Resources Used:
- Remix IDE: [Remix Ethereum](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
