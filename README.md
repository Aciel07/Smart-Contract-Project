# CoffeePoints Smart Contract

## Description  
A Solidity-based rewards system designed to simulate a real-world loyalty program. This program allows users to earn points by purchasing coffee, redeem points for rewards, and transfer points to others. It implements Solidity's `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements to ensure the integrity and reliability of transactions.
